I propose the following:

Chiu - I think the biggest thing is that section VI needs to be merged
       with section III, and then we need to add clear definitions of the
       different request types.  Please read my detailed comments in the
       paper.  Can you be in charge of addressing that?

Shun - I believe the rest of the comments should be addressable by you.
       Please let me know if there are others that you think you need
       help with.  For you, I think the biggest issue is that the
       experimental results section needs to be clearer.  It needs to be
       so clear that someone could completely reproduce our graphs if
       they wanted to.  We also need to be a bit more clear about the
       hypotehses we're testing (the goals of the experiments).  I tried
       to add some things to help that already.
