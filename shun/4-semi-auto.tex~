\section{Semi-Autonomous Vehicles}
\label{sec:vehicles}

Dresner and Stone proposed the FCFS-signal policy, which makes AIM
compatible with human drivers~\cite{bib:Dresner07Sharing}.  According
to their study, when more than 5-10\% of traffic is comprised of
human-driven vehicles, the average delay time of all vehicles
increases significantly.  For one thing, the human-driven vehicles
themselves may not enter the intersection during red signal phases.
But more importantly, they prevent the autonomous vehicles from
obtaining reservations when they are behind such stalled vehicles.  To
allow more efficient management of traffic at intersections, we
consider human-driven vehicles with additional communication features
to facilitate interaction with the IM and other vehicles. In this
paper, we use the term \emph{semi-autonomous vehicles} to refer to
both the vehicles with simple/adaptive cruise control and human-driven
vehicles with additional communication capabilities. We consider the
following categories of vehicles.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Autonomous vehicles (Type A).} These are fully
autonomous vehicles that can be totally controlled by computers.

\item \textbf{Semi-autonomous vehicles (Type SA).}
Although they are driven by humans,
they have some devices that can assist human drivers and
can communicate with the IM. In this paper, 
we consider three concrete types of SA vehicles, 
as specified in this section.

\item \textbf{Human-driven vehicles (Type H).}
These vehicles are exactly the same as the ones on today's
roads. They are completely controlled by humans and have no
communication with the IM.

\end{itemize}

Moreover, we classify semi-autonomous vehicles according to the
equipment on the vehicles. We consider the following set of
equipment that can be put on a semi-autonomous vehicle.  These
equipment are based on technology that are readily available.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Adaptive cruise control} A vehicle can be set to follow
another vehicle in front of it.  This feature is currently available
as an option in some high-end vehicles. A vehicle with this feature
can propose an \textit{anchor request} that will be discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:request}.  The IM considers whether it can safely
traverse the intersection by following the vehicle in front of it.

\item \textbf{Simple Cruise control} A vehicle can be set to maintain
a constant velocity by turning on cruise control. This is a technology
that is widely available today. A vehicle with this feature can
propose a \textit{constant-velocity request}. The IM considers whether
it can traverse the intersection by keeping a constant velocity.

\item \textbf{Communication device} This is a device, which can be a
smart-phone or on-board navigation system, that can communicate with
the Intersection Manager.  It can gather data from the vehicle, and
show instructions to human when necessary.  For example, in red
signals, the IM tells the driver that it is now safe to enter the
intersection.  A vehicle with this feature can propose a
\textit{whole-row request} to reserve an entire lane in the
intersection for the vehicle.  Obviously this is a very strong request
and is only likely to be confirmed in very light traffic in which an
entire ``row'' is available.

\end{itemize}

These equipment give semi-autonomous vehicles some of the
functionality of autonomous vehicles, even though human drivers still
retain some control of the vehicles.  In the following, we introduce
several types of semi-autonomous vehicles that utilize these
equipment.

\noindent
\textbf{Type SA-ACC Vehicles} utilizes all of the above equipment
when making a reservation:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Propose an anchor request. If the vehicle in front of it is
(semi-)autonomous and is going in the same direction, then if they can
both get reservations, the request is confirmed. The vehicle can
follow the front vehicle and enter the intersection.

\item If the anchor request is denied, propose a constant-velocity request. If 
keeping the current velocity it can safely traverse the intersection,
the request is confirmed.

\item If the constant-velocity request is denied, propose a whole-row
request. If there is no conflict and the vehicle can enter the
intersection directly, the request is confirmed.

\item If denied again, decelerate to stop, and retry step 3 or pass control
to the human.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{Type SA-CC Vehicles} mainly utilizes simple cruise control
in the following way.
\begin{enumerate}

\item Propose a constant-velocity request. If it can enter the
intersection by keeping the current velocity, the request is
confirmed.

\item If the constant-velocity request is denied, propose a whole-row
  request. If the entire lane is available, the request is confirmed.

\item If denied again, decelerate to stop, and retry step 2 or pass control
  to the human.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{Type SA-Com Vehicles} utilizes only communication devices
to make reservations:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Propose a whole-row request.  If the entire lane is available,
the request is confirmed.

\item If denied, decelerate to stop, and retry step 1 or pass control
  to the human.

\end{enumerate}

Table~\ref{table:type} summarizes the equipment being used on
different types of semi-autonomous vehicles.

\section{Interfaces and Safety}

Safety is a common (and quite reasonable) concern when involving human
drivers in the control loop of autonomous vehicles.  In the
semi-autonomous vehicles we introduced in the previous section, a
human driver could intervene and simply follow the traffic signal at
any time. In this section, we describe how our proposed protocol can
be realized safely, as long as no driver runs a red light (without a
reservation granted).

For the drivers of vehicle types SA-ACC, SA-CC, and SA-Com, we assume inclusion in
the vehicle of a single button that signals the driver agent to ask
for a reservation.  We opt for such an active ``opt-in'' interface so
as to allow drivers to drive as they do today if they do not signal
their intention for a semi-autonomous reservation.  It is also
important that there is a clear indicator (such as a green light)
installed in the car which indicates when the request has been
confirmed.  The driver must be clear about the current situation and
not surprised by the sudden autonomous actions of the vehicle.

In Type SA-Com vehicles, the driver can safely enter the intersection
when the request is confirmed. If the request is confirmed and the
driver decides not to enter, it still does no harm (even though the
tiles it requested are wasted).  When the reservation is granted to
Types SA-ACC and SA-CC vehicles, the vehicle starts controlling the
speed.  If the person touches the brakes or accelerator, the person
regains control, and the reservation is cancelled.

There is a point near the entry of the intersection where it is no
longer possible to brake before entering the intersection. Beyond this
point, the person loses the ability to take back control of the speed
until leaving the intersection (presumably with an emergency override
option for extreme situations).  This constraint is based on the
possibility that if the driver were to change its velocity, its
reservation would be modified.  The IM cannot guarantee that the
modified reservation will be confirmed.

Drivers can steer in type SA-CC vehicles. For type SA-ACC, the vehicle
might follow a vehicle in front of it to make a turn. The driver would
cede control over the steering wheel in this case.


% \section{Definitions}

% A road $r$ consists a finite number of lanes $l_1$, $l_2$, \ldots,
% $l_n$.  We write $r = (1_1, l_2, \ldots l_n)$.
% All lanes in a road are in the same direction.
% An \emph{entry} road of an intersection is a road
% from which traffic flows into the intersection.
% An \emph{exit} road is a road from which traffic flows out of
% an intersection.


% \section{A General AIM architecture}

% We generalize the AIM architecture as follows.

% \commentc{Maybe draw a diagram to show to how AIM works}

% This framework can be considered as an extension to AIM.
% In AIM, each request is a $4$-tuple $\langle t, v, l_1, l_2 \rangle$.
% \commentc{Fit AIM requests into the next framework.}

% In AIM, these values are *exact*. However, in SemiAIM,
% these values can be constrained.

% No need to think about the acceleration schedule yet.

% In essence, no human intervention is involved in the control loop.
