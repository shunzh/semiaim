The main context of our work is an extension to the FCFS policy
proposed by Dresner and Stone~\cite{bib:Dresner08Multiagent}. Their
experimental results indicated that a mixture of human-driven vehicles
and autonomous vehicles is possible, and leads to better performance
than having all human-driven vehicles, which is the current status
quo.  However, their experiments indicated that the impact of
autonomous vehicles is expected to be relatively small until almost all (90-95\%) of
the vehicles on the road are autonomous.  Our extension to embrace
semi-autonomous vehicles shows significant performance benefits all
along the technology penetration curve.

Our work is similar to the analysis of adaptive cruise control
performance by Jerath and Brennan, who showed that by introducing
adaptive cruise control vehicles into traffic, the vehicles would have
a more \textit{condensed} formation, thus increasing the efficiency
of traffic~\cite{bib:Jerath10adaptive}.
% When compared to our work,
% there are two key differences.  First, we are focusing on the
% intersection---a place more critical both from the points of view of
% congestion and safety, while the analysis of Jerath and Brennan is
% focused on highways.  Second, we study five types of vehicles,
% compared to the three types considered by Jerath and Brennan.

% Although we are not aware of any other work that is directly concerned
% with the interaction of semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles,
% research on vehicular autonomy in general has made significant
% progress in recent years.  This was in part due to a series of robotic
% car competitions such as the \emph{DARPA Grand
% Challenges}~\cite{DARPAGrandChallenge}.  These competitions
% accelerated the development of autonomous vehicles to the point where
% the technical challenge of open-road autonomous driving is considered
% by some to be essentially solved~\cite{bib:Dresner08Multiagent}.  When
% pushed to extremes, autonomous vehicles can even outperform many
% human drivers in carrying out intricate
% maneuvers~\cite{Squatriglia2010}. The non-technical barrier for the
% adaptation of autonomous vehicles are largely traffic laws and
% regulations, though progress is also being made in these
% areas~\cite{calo2011-nevada}.

The vast majority of research on autonomous vehicles focuses on how to
ensure they run on existing road infrastructure; there is limited
literature on understanding changes to road infrastructure that can
facilitate vehicular autonomy.  One such project on jointly optimizing
autonomous vehicles and road infrastructure is the PATH program, which
relies on magnetic markers in the roadway for measuring steering angle
and vehicle movements~\cite{bib:Shladover91Automated}.  The
AIM protocol~\cite{bib:Dresner08Multiagent, bib:Fajardo12Automated,
bib:Quinlan10Bringing} is a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mechanism in
which vehicles request space-time in the intersection for their
trajectories prior to arriving at the intersection; a server at the
intersection handles these requests, granting or rejecting
reservations using a grid-based collision detection scheme. This
protocol is enhanced to reduce network traffic and increase safety
using spatial-temporal buffers surrounding the vehicles~\cite{bib:Fajardo12Automated}.
Another popular form of autonomous intersection management
is Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), which has been investigated~\cite{naumann97:intersection,
ATT08-vanmiddlesworth}.  In this form, no centralized server is
required (i.e., there is no single point of failure) and vehicles
coordinate in a peer-to-peer fashion when crossing the
intersection.
% Naumann {\em et al.} investigated a distributed policy
% that uses virtual ``tokens'' that a vehicle must possess to cross
% certain contested areas of the
% intersection~\cite{naumann97:intersection} and formally evaluated it
% using petri-nets.  VanMiddlesworth {\em et al.} developed an
% AIM-inspired protocol that enables vehicles to ``call ahead'' to
% reserve space-time in the
% intersection~\cite{ATT08-vanmiddlesworth}. Their protocol outperformed
% the traditional stop sign in light traffic. The anchor requests 
% introduced in this paper can be implemented using V2V communications.

% We implemented a slightly
% simplified version of the protocol in~\cite{ATT08-vanmiddlesworth}
% that does not use estimated time of arrival and demonstrated that it
% also outperforms a stop sign in light traffic.

Other researchers have investigated autonomous intersections using
real systems involving multiple mobile vehicles.  For example, Kolodko
and Vlacic used golf-cart-like Imara vehicles in evaluating an
autonomous intersection~\cite{Kolodko03:INRIA}. 
% In their study, all
% vehicles must come to a complete stop at the intersection irrespective
% of traffic conditions.  Our work differs from this, and all other
% previous research by incorporating semi-autonomous vehicles into the
% mix, along with autonomous and human-driven cars.

%The

%most.


% We did not require platooning in our analysis. Vehicles appear randomly
% at the spawning point of each lane. This is also the case for other
% policies that we are going to compare with in this paper.  Our
% analysis is also universal, not restricted to any manufacture. We will
% list the features of each type of semi-autonomous vehicles. Any type
% of cruise control vehicle or adaptive cruise control vehicle that
% satisfy these features can all be applied to the policy mentioned in
% our paper.
