\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

This paper introduces SemiAIM, a new constraint-based autonomous
intersection management system that includes human-driven vehicles
and semi-autonomous vehicles, in addition to fully autonomous
vehicles, to make reservations and enter an intersection within the
AIM paradigm.  Our experimental results showed that our system can
greatly decrease traffic delay when most vehicles are semi-autonomous,
even when few (if any) are fully autonomous.  

This study opens up several interesting directions for future work.
For example, it is an open question how the different types of
constraint-based reservation requests affect the efficiency of
SemiAIM.  It will also be important to study in detail the performance
of SemiAIM under a variety of different traffic levels, and with
different amounts of traffic traveling in different directions.
