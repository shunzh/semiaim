\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This abstract introduces SemiAIM, a new multiagent constraint-based
autonomous intersection management system that enables human-driven
vehicles and semi-autonomous vehicles, in addition to fully autonomous
vehicles, to make reservations and enter an intersection within the
AIM paradigm.  To the best of our knowledge, SemiAIM is the first
multiagent protocol to enable smooth interactions between
human-driven, fully autonomous, and semi-autonomous vehicles.  Our
initial
experiment showed that our system can greatly decrease
traffic delay when most vehicles are semi-autonomous, even when few
(if any) are fully autonomous.
