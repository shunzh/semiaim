% \section{Constraint-based Reservation Systems}
% \label{sec:constraint}

SemiAIM extends AIM by allowing human-driven vehicles and
semi-autonomous vehicles to make reservations in the same way as
fully autonomous vehicles.  The key idea of SemiAIM is to turn AIM into a
\emph{constraint-based reservation system}, which allows vehicles to
make reservations in terms of constraints over 1) their driving
profiles such as their arrival time and arrival velocity, and 2) the
relationships with other vehicles.
To facilitate communication with all kinds of
semi-autonomous vehicles, SemiAIM uses a \emph{unified}
language for vehicles to express their constraints in the same format
in their requests.  We define \emph{constraint-based} reservation
requests as follows.  A request message consists of four components:
\begin{small_ind_s_itemize}
\item{\bf Intention}: The direction in which the vehicle intends to
  move.
\item{\bf Vehicle Type}: The type of vehicle.
\item{\bf Entry Condition}: The condition under which the vehicle
  will enter the intersection.
\item{\bf Acceleration Profile List}: The list of possible acceleration schedules
  from among which the vehicle will choose one to follow
  during the traversal of the intersection.
