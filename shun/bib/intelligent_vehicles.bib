Unlike previous challenges, the Urban Challenge vehicles had to follow the California laws for driving, including properly handling traffic. This article presents the modular algorithms developed largely by undergraduates at The University of Texas at Austin as part of the Austin Robot Technology team. We emphasize the aspects of the system that are relevant to multiagent interactions. Specifically, we discuss how our vehicle tracked and reacted to nearby traffic in order to allow our autonomous vehicle to safely follow and pass, merge into moving traffic, obey intersection precedence, and park.",

  In this study subjects were asked about their competence as drivers
  in relation to a group of drivers. The results showed that a
  majority of subjects regarded themselves as more skillful and less
  risky than the average driver in each group respectively. This
  result was compared with similar recent findings in other
  fields. Finally, the consequences for planning and risk taking of
  seeing oneself as more competent than others were discussed briefly.
