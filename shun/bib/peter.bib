	Artificial intelligence research is ushering in a new era of
	sophisticated, mass-market transportation technology.  While computers
	can already fly a passenger jet better than a trained human pilot,
	people are still faced with the dangerous yet tedious task of driving
	automobiles. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the field that
	focuses on integrating information technology with vehicles and
	transportation infrastructure to make transportation safer, cheaper, and
	more efficient.  Recent advances in ITS point to a
	future in which vehicles themselves handle the vast majority of the
	driving task.  Once autonomous vehicles become popular, autonomous
	interactions amongst \emph{multiple} vehicles will be possible.  Current
	methods of vehicle coordination, which are all designed to work with
	human drivers, will be outdated.  The bottleneck for roadway
	efficiency will no longer be the drivers, but rather the mechanism by
	which those drivers' actions are coordinated. While open-road driving
	is a well-studied and more-or-less-solved problem, urban traffic
	scenarios, especially intersections, are much more challenging.
	We believe current methods for controlling traffic, specifically at
	intersections, will not be able to take advantage of the increased
	sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles as compared to human
	drivers. In this article, we suggest an alternative mechanism for
	coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through intersections.
	Drivers and intersections in this mechanism are treated as autonomous agents
	in a multiagent system. In this multiagent system, intersections use a new
	reservation-based approach built around a detailed communication protocol,
	which we also present. We demonstrate in simulation that our new mechanism
	has the potential to significantly outperform current intersection control
	technology---traffic lights and stop signs. Because our mechanism can
	emulate a traffic light or stop sign, it subsumes the most popular current
	methods of intersection control. This article also presents two extensions
	to the mechanism. The first extension allows the system to control
	human-driven vehicles in addition to autonomous vehicles. The second gives
	priority to emergency vehicles without significant cost to civilian
	vehicles. The mechanism, including both extensions, is implemented and
	tested in simulation, and we present experimental results that strongly
	attest to the efficacy of this approach.

  abstract={
  As computers inevitably begin to replace humans as the drivers of
  automobiles, our current human-centric traffic management mechanisms
  will give way to hyper-efficient systems and protocols specifically
  designed to exploit the capabilities of fully autonomous vehicles.
  We have introduced such a system for coordinating large numbers of
  autonomous vehicles at
  intersections.  Our
  experiments suggest that this system could alleviate many of the
  dangers and delays associated with intersections by allowing
  vehicles to ``call ahead'' to an agent stationed at the intersection
  and reserve time and space for their traversal.  Unfortunately, such
  a system is not cost-effective at small intersections, as it
  requires the installation of specialized infrastructure.  In this
  paper, we propose an intersection control mechanism for autonomous
  vehicles designed specifically for low-traffic intersections where
  the previous system would not be practical, just as inexpensive stop
  signs are used at intersections that do not warrant a full traffic
  light installation.  Our mechanism is based on purely peer-to-peer
  communication and thus requires no infrastructure at the
  intersection.  We present experimental results demonstrating that
  our system, while not suited to large, busy intersections, can
  significantly outperform traditional stop signs at small
  intersections: vehicles spend less time waiting and consume less
  fuel.

The developed framework improves the safety and efficiency of driverless city vehicles. Furthermore, this paper also elaborates on the vehicle control software architecture. On-road tests of both the communication framework and its application for real-time decision making show that the communication framework is reliable and useful for improving the safe operation of driverless city vehicles.
