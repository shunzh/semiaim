  abstract = {
  Ground traffic systems are the combination of ground vehicles, roads, highways and intersection
  infrastructure that make it possible for people to commute on the road. Recent advances in the ﬁeld
  of robotics allow us to increase the autonomy of currently human-operated ground traffic systems.
  This document presents the key software components developed as a part of this thesis research to
  create an autonomous vehicle platform; speciﬁcally, a lane-based obstacle tracking system which
  enabled our autonomous vehicle, Marvin, to successfully handle dynamic traffic. Furthermore, the
  Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) protocol designed by Dresner and Stone shows that
  intersection efficiency can be signiﬁcantly increased if the intersection can communicate wirelessly
  with autonomous vehicles. Towards this end, this document presents the extensions made to Marvin’s
  capabilities so that it would communicate with the AIM system thereby bringing us closer to an
  Autonomous Ground Traffic System.

  abstract = {
The results of research involving a well-designed before-and-after evaluation of the safety effects of providing left- and right-turn lanes for at-grade intersections are presented. Geometric design, traffic control, traffic volume, and traffic accident data were gathered for a total of 280 improved intersections as well as 300 similar intersections that were not improved during the study period. The types of improvement projects evaluated included installation of added left-turn lanes, added right-turn lanes, and extension of the length of existing left- or right-turn lanes. An observational before-and-after evaluation of these projects was performed by using several alternative evaluation approaches. Three contrasting approaches to before-and-after evaluation were used: the yoked comparison or matched-pair approach, the comparison group approach, and the empirical Bayes approach. The research not only evaluated the safety effectiveness of left- and right-turn lane improvements but also compared the performances of these three alternative approaches in making such evaluations. The research developed quantitative safety effectiveness measures for installation design improvements involving added left-turn lanes and added right-turn lanes. The research concluded that the empirical Bayes method provides the most accurate and reliable results. Further use of this method is recommended.

               transportation processes is the core of many
               intelligent transportation systems decision support
               tools. Reinforcement learning, an artificial
               intelligence approach undergoing development in the
               machine-learning community, offers key advantages in
               this regard. The ability of a control agent to learn
               relationships between control actions and their
               effect on the environment while pursuing a goal is a
               distinct improvement over prespecified models of the
               environment. Prespecified models are a prerequisite
               of conventional control methods and their accuracy
               limits the performance of control agents. This paper
               contains an introduction to Q-learning, a simple yet
               powerful reinforcement learning algorithm, and
               presents a case study involving application to
               traffic signal control. Encouraging results of the
               application to an isolated traffic signal,
               particularly under variable traffic conditions, are
               presented. A broader research effort is outlined,
               including extension to linear and networked signal
               systems and integration with dynamic route
               guidance. The research objective involves optimal
               control of heavily congested traffic across a
               two-dimensional road network -- a challenging task for
               conventional traffic signal control methodologies.
