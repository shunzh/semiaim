\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This abstract introduces SemiAIM, a new multiagent constraint-based
autonomous intersection management system that enables human-driven
vehicles and semi-autonomous vehicles, in addition to fully autonomous
vehicles, to make reservations and enter an intersection within the
AIM paradigm.  To the best of our knowledge, SemiAIM is the first
multiagent protocol to enable smooth interactions between
human-driven, fully autonomous, and semi-autonomous vehicles.  Our
initial
experiment showed that our system can greatly decrease
traffic delay when most vehicles are semi-autonomous, even when few
(if any) are fully autonomous.

% This study opens up several interesting directions for future work.
% For example, an open question is how to design better constraint-based
% reservation requests using more accurate profiling of the vehicles'
% physical behavior.  It will also be important to study in detail the
% performance of SemiAIM under a variety of different, or varying,
% traffic levels, and with different amounts of traffic traveling in
% different directions.


% the different types of
% constraint-based reservation requests affect the efficiency of
% SemiAIM.  Some reservation requests are much less efficient than the
% others, and how to design 
% efficient reservation requests is an
% important topic for the future.  




% ---not restricted to ones
% described in this paper, but general reservation requests that can be
% understood by the intersection manager---
