\section{Simulation Results}

To demonstrate the feasibility of SemiAIM as well as evaluate the
hypothesis that SemiAIM can offer substantial improvements over
traffic signals and FCFS-Signal, we modified the AIM4 simulator at
\url{http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~aim} to simulate the behavior of
vehicles in the constraint-based reservation system and measured the
average delays of vehicles under (1) AIM, (2) SemiAIM, and (3) traffic
signals with optimized signal timing. In all experiments,
we spawn vehicles in each lane according to a Poisson distribution with the
expectation of 360 vehicles per hour. We denote this setting as
traffic level = 360 vehicles/hour/lane.\footnote{We choose this
traffic level as being high enough to cause significant delays at
signals, but light enough to allow for benefits even if cars are not
precisely controlled. Figure~\ref{fig:figure5} examines higher traffic
levels.} We assume the intersection is fully observable to the intersection
manager.

We expect that in the presence of semi-autonomous vehicles, SemiAIM
will provide significant advantages over FCFS-Signal if we assume that
semi-autonomous vehicles have to act as fully human-driven vehicles in
FCFS-Signal.  However, we do not expect that semi-autonomous traffic
under SemiAIM will perform as well as fully autonomous traffic in AIM.
The goal of SemiAIM is not to replace AIM, but rather to provide many
of its benefits prior in the time period between today, when most cars
are driven fully manually, and the time when all cars are fully
autonomous.  To do so, it leverages features of semi-autonomy, that we
expect will be widespread much sooner than full autonomy.

The traffic signal phase plan we use is shown in
Table~\ref{table:phase}.\commentp{how was this plan arrived at?  Why isn't it symmetric? (why 30s for East-West but 40s for North-South?)}
According to this plan, there is a 30 second
green phase for traffic coming from East and West, followed by a 3
second yellow phase and a 5 second red phase. Then, there is a 8
second green phase for traffic from South direction only, followed by
a 3 second yellow phase and a 5 second red phase, etc.

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
Direction & Green Phase & Yellow Phase & Red Phase \\
\hline
  East-West & 30s & 3s & 5s \\
  South & \ 8s & 3s & 5s \\
  East & 10s & 1s & 5s \\
  North-South & 40s & 3s & 5s \\
  West & 10s & 1s & 5s \\
  North & \ 8s & 3s & 5s \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The experiments were conducted in a $3 \times 3$ intersection (3 lanes
in each direction).\commentp{Since there's space, we can show a
screenshot.}  In all cases, we measure the average vehicle delay,
where delay is computed as the increase in travel time compared to
traversing the intersection without slowing down at all, as if no
other vehicles were on the road. Thus, lower delays correspond to
better performance.  This measure is the same one used in
\cite{bib:Dresner08Multiagent}. For all the vehicles, both the static
buffer and the edge time buffer are 0.25 meters (see
\cite{bib:Dresner08Multiagent} for details), when auto-controlled.  No
such constraint is relevant to human-driven vehicles. However, there
can be an alert to human drivers if the detected distance to another
vehicle is too small.\commentp{I don't think that last sentence is
needed - unless it becomes a part of the official protocol for
semi-autonomous vehicles.}

In the first experiment, the traffic consisted of all five types of
vehicles we defined in Section~\ref{sec:vehicles}.  We gradually
increased the percentage of autonomous vehicles while keeping the
traffic level at 360 vehicles/hour/lane.  We compared two variants of
SemiAIM using optimized traffic signals such that all vehicles must
follow the traffic signals.  For Figures 1 and 2, the experiments only
contain two types of vehicles---autonomous vehicles (Type A) and the
type of vehicles specified in the legends.\commentp{Why are the legends different?  One uses the type acronyms, and one spells them out...}
Along the x axis, the ratio
of autonomous vehicles starts at 1 and the ratio of semi-autonomous
vehicles start at 0. Then the ratio of semi-autonomous vehicles
increases and that of autonomous ones decreases.
\commentp{An example is needed here.  What exactly is going on when the x-axis is .4 (for example), in the line labled Type H?  How many autonomous, semi-autonomous, and human-driven cars?  This paragraph isn't clear yet.}
In
Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}, we isolate the features for different types
of semi-autonomous vehicles and only consider one at a time.  The
vehicles with communication devices outperform the vehicles with
either type of cruise control. 
\commentp{Again, an example would help.  I don't understand from this description or the caption what's going on in the graph.}
So, keeping a constant speed, as an
approximation of the performance of autonomous vehicles' chance, is
not as valuable as letting the intersection manager to know when the
vehicle is going to enter the intersection.\commentp{I don't understand this last sentence.}

\end{figure}

% Figure~\ref{fig:figure1} shows that as the number of autonomous
% vehicles increases, the average delay decreases. In particular, when
% most vehicles are autonomous, the average delay is close to zero.  In
% the second experiment, we created a traffic consisting of
% human-controlled vehicles and two kinds of semi-autonomous vehicles
% but no autonomous vehicles.  We measured the average delay of all
% vehicles when we gradually increased the percentage of semi-autonomous
% vehicles.  Then we compared SemiAIM with optimized traffic signals.
% The results in Figure~\ref{fig:figure2} shows that as the number of
% semi-autonomous vehicles increases, the average delay decreases under
% SemiAIM.  While the decrease is not as dramatic as the decrease when
% the percentage of autonomous vehicles is near 100\% in
% Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}, SemiAIM can reduce about 43\% of the average
% delay when most vehicles are semi-autonomous.

Next, in Figure~\ref{fig:figure2}, we compare the performance of
different types of vehicles---recall that each type of vehicles can
have several features. We can observe that vehicles with more features
can achieve lower delay. Even without any autonomous vehicles, the
combination of semi-autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles can
reduce the delay time by 40\%, when compared to all human-driven
vehicles.\commentp{How can we see that in the graph?}

In addition, we compared the performance in traffic with a mixture of
different types of vehicles.  We conducted two experiments to test 1)
the effect of gradually shifting from human-driven vehicles to
autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, and 2) the effect of shifting
from semi-autonomous vehicles to fully autonomous vehicles.  The
schedule for shifting is indicated in Tables~\ref{table:3}
and~\ref{table:4}, which can be used to interpret the mix of vehicles
along the x-axes of Figures~\ref{fig:figure3} and~\ref{fig:figure4}
respectively.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Gradually replace human-driven vehicles with semi-autonomous
  vehicles. The result shows that with appearance of more autonomous
  and semi-autonomous vehicles (i.e.\ fewer human-driven vehicles), the
  delay time decreases. The result is shown in
  Figure~\ref{fig:figure3}.

\item Gradually replace semi-autonomous vehicles with fully autonomous
  vehicles. The result shows that when the percentage of human
  vehicles is fixed, the delay time decreases with appearance
  of more autonomous vehicles (i.e.\ fewer semi-autonomous vehicles).
  The result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:figure4}.

\end{enumerate}

The performance of semi-autonomous vehicles can be significantly
better than human-driven vehicles in small traffic levels. However,
the benefits decrease significantly at higher traffic levels.  In
Figure~\ref{fig:figure5}, we increase the traffic level to 540
vehicles/hour/lane. At this traffic level, congestion appears.  It is
true that semi-autonomy would not ``harm'' normal traffic which
follows traffic signals, but they have almost no chance to enter the
intersection in phases other than when the signal is green. This
condition leads to little or no improvement over traditional traffic
light policy.

This result confirms our hypothesis that while semi-autonomous
vehicles can significantly bridge the gap between the time when all
vehicles are human-driven to that when most are autonomous, there will
likely always remain strong benefits of full autonomy, especially at
high traffic levels.  Nevertheless, for lower levels of traffic, the
benefits of semi-autonomy can be large.
