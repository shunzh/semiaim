\begin{abstract}
Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) is a reservation-based
intersection control protocol that leverages the capacities of
autonomous vehicles to dramatically reduce traffic delay at
intersections. AIM is designed for the time when all, or most, of the
vehicles on the road are autonomous.  But we anticipate that there
will be a long transition period during which many cars are still
driven by human drivers and/or most vehicles have some but not all
capabilities of fully autonomous vehicles.  In fact, this transition
period has silently begun---adaptive cruise control systems and lane
departure warning systems have become widely available as optional
equipment on luxury production vehicles since the late '90s.  In this
paper, we introduce a new protocol called \emph{Semi-Autonomous
Intersection Management} (SemiAIM), which allows vehicles with
partially-autonomous features such as adaptive cruise control to make
reservations in AIM.  We demonstrate the feasibility for vehicles with
limited autonomy to make reservations to enter an intersection in
AIM-like style.  Our simulation results show that traffic delay of
semi-autonomous vehicles in SemiAIM can be greatly reduced.
