% This is "aamas2014.tex", a revised version of aamas2013.tex
% This file should be compiled with "aamas2014.cls" 
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'aamas2014.cls'
% LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to AAMAS 2014  conference. This file is based on
% the sig-alternate.tex example file.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file of ACM will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
% than the original style ACM style.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls ) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with AAMAS data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) through 3) above.
%
% Using 'aamas2014.cls' you don't have control
% from within the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the IFAAMAS Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% These information will be overwritten by fixed AAMAS 2014  information
% in the style files - it is NOT as you are used with ACM style files.

% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\begin{abstract}
Autonomous Intersection Management
(AIM) is a reservation-based intersection control protocol that
leverages the capacities of autonomous vehicles to dramatically reduce
traffic delay at intersections. AIM was designed for the time when
all, or most, of the vehicles on the road are \emph{fully} autonomous.
However, we anticipate that there will be a long transition
period during which many cars are still driven by human drivers and/or
most vehicles have some but not all capabilities of fully autonomous
vehicles. In order to accommodate this transition, this paper
introduces a new multiagent protocol called \emph{Semi-Autonomous
Intersection Management} (SemiAIM), which allows vehicles with
partially-autonomous features such as adaptive cruise control to make
reservations in AIM.  We propose a method for vehicles with limited
autonomy to make reservations to enter an intersection in an AIM-like
style and conduct experiments in simulation to evaluate its
effectiveness.  Our results show that the delay of semi-autonomous
vehicles in SemiAIM can be greatly reduced compared to human-driven
vehicles.
\end{abstract}


% In fact, this transition period has already begun---adaptive cruise
% control systems and lane departure warning systems have become widely
% available as optional equipment on luxury production vehicles since
% the late 1990s.
