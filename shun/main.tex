\begin{abstract}
Recent advances in autonomous vehicle technology will open the door to
highly efficient transportation systems in the future, as demonstrated
by Autonomous Intersection Management, an intersection control
protocol designed for fully autonomous vehicles.  We, however,
anticipate there will be a long transition period during which most
vehicles have some but not all capabilities of fully autonomous
vehicles. This paper introduces a new protocol called
\emph{Semi-Autonomous Intersection Management}, which allows vehicles
with partially-autonomous features such as adaptive cruise control to
enter an intersection from different directions simultaneously.  Our
experiments show that this protocol can greatly decrease traffic delay
when most vehicles are semi-autonomous.  Our incremental deployment
study reveals that traffic delay keeps decreasing as 
more and more vehicles employ features of autonomy.
\end{abstract}

% In order to accommodate this transition, 


% In fact, this transition period has already begun---adaptive cruise
% control systems and lane departure warning systems have become widely
% available as optional equipment on luxury production vehicles since
% the late 1990s.
